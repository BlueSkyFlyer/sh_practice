        	Instructor Assisted Deployment is a training method that opens your parachute almost immediately upon leaving the aircraft (about 3-4 seconds of freefall). You are never attached to the plane (like static-line) and the deployment sequence is identical to the way experienced skydivers open their own parachutes. This thrilling, solo, 'do it by yourself' method is also a way to train to become a licensed skydiver.

        Well over half of our students choose the IAD jump, even if they want to only jump once.  Classes are held most Saturdays (or Sunday by special reservation), mid-April through mid-October.  Training starts in the morning and if weather permits, jump in the afternoon (from 3500 feet!)  Radio contact assists you in landing your parachute safely (about 4-5 minute canopy ride). A digital color video of your exit is available for purchase. Reservations required. See our Video page for an IAD video or our IAD Picture page or our IAD Exit Digital Sequence Photos.

            Jump from 10,000 feet attached to your instructor with a parachute built for two! Go along for the ride of your life!  Tandem skydiving has made it easy to enjoy the exciting sport of skydiving.  You will be harnessed to the front of a fully licensed, professional and friendly tandem instructor.  Your instructor is in charge every step of the way, from aircraft exit, to freefall, (for about 30 seconds at 120 MPH!), to a comfortable, accurate landing (about 5-7 minutes).  For more fun, you can purchase a video of your entire amazing jump taken by one of our aerial photographers.  About a half an hour of training.  Appointment necessary.   See our Video page for a tandem video or our Tandem Picture page.
